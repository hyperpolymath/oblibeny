= Oblibeny Roadmap
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Project Status

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Repository project specification - will be uploaded shortly**

This meta-repository coordinates the Oblibeny ecosystem. Detailed specifications,
architecture documents, and implementation roadmaps for each component will be
added as the project develops.
====

== Ecosystem Components

=== obli-transpiler-framework

*Status:* Specification pending

*Purpose:* Transform standard programs into oblivious equivalents that hide
access patterns from observers.

*Planned capabilities:*

* [ ] Source-to-source transpilation for oblivious execution
* [ ] Support for multiple target backends
* [ ] Static analysis for access pattern detection
* [ ] Optimization passes for oblivious code

=== obli-riscv-dev-kit

*Status:* Specification pending

*Purpose:* RISC-V toolchain and development environment with native oblivious
computing support.

*Planned capabilities:*

* [ ] RISC-V emulator with oblivious memory access
* [ ] Custom ISA extensions for oblivious operations
* [ ] Development toolchain (assembler, linker, debugger)
* [ ] Hardware simulation for oblivious execution units

=== obli-fs

*Status:* Specification pending

*Purpose:* Filesystem implementation providing oblivious access patterns,
preventing observers from inferring file access behavior.

*Planned capabilities:*

* [ ] ORAM-based file storage
* [ ] Path-oblivious directory traversal
* [ ] Encrypted metadata with access pattern hiding
* [ ] POSIX-compatible interface layer

== Research Foundation

Oblivious computing builds on established cryptographic research:

* **Oblivious RAM (ORAM)** - Hides memory access patterns
* **Oblivious Transfer (OT)** - Secure two-party computation primitive
* **Path ORAM** - Efficient tree-based ORAM construction
* **Circuit ORAM** - Optimized for smaller block sizes

== Development Phases

=== Phase 1: Foundation
* [ ] Complete ecosystem specification
* [ ] Define inter-component interfaces
* [ ] Establish security model and threat assumptions
* [ ] Set up development infrastructure

=== Phase 2: Core Implementation
* [ ] obli-fs basic ORAM backend
* [ ] obli-transpiler-framework parsing and IR
* [ ] obli-riscv-dev-kit emulator foundation

=== Phase 3: Integration
* [ ] Cross-component testing framework
* [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
* [ ] Security audit preparation

=== Phase 4: Hardening
* [ ] Formal verification of critical paths
* [ ] Side-channel analysis and mitigation
* [ ] Documentation and developer guides
