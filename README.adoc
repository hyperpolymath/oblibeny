*Oblivious computing ecosystem - privacy-preserving computation tools*

== Overview

Oblibeny provides a coordinated suite of tools for building applications with
strong access-pattern privacy guarantees. Unlike encryption alone, oblivious
computing prevents observers from learning *what* data is accessed, *when* it
is accessed, and *how often* - even if they can see all encrypted traffic.

[NOTE]
====
**Repository project specification - will be uploaded shortly**

See link:ROADMAP.adoc[ROADMAP.adoc] for development phases and planned capabilities.

== What is Oblivious Computing?

Traditional encryption protects data *content* but leaks *access patterns*.
An observer watching encrypted traffic can learn:

* Which files you access
* How frequently you access them
* The order of accesses
* Correlations between accesses

Oblivious computing techniques (ORAM, oblivious algorithms, path-hiding
structures) eliminate these side channels. The observer learns nothing beyond
the total volume of activity.

=== Use Cases

* **Private databases** - Query patterns reveal nothing about queries
* **Secure file storage** - Access patterns hidden from storage providers
* **Confidential computing** - Programs execute without leaking behavior
* **Privacy-preserving analytics** - Compute on encrypted data obliviously
