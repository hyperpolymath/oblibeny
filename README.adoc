What is Oblíbený?

Oblíbený (Czech: "beloved" or "favorite") is a revolutionary programming language that fundamentally rethinks how we write, verify, and deploy software. It combines:


🔐 Security by Design: Two-phase compilation ensures deployment-time code is provably terminating and resource-bounded

🤖 First-Class AI: AI effects are typed, tracked, and verified at compile-time

✅ Distributed Verification: BOINC-powered crowd-sourced formal verification of language properties

🌍 Sustainability-Focused: Explicit resource tracking for energy, carbon, and computational costs

📐 Formally Verified: Properties proven through property-based testing and formal methods

The Two-Phase Philosophy

Key Features


🎯 Core Language Features



Lisp-Inspired S-Expression Syntax: Clean, consistent, and easy to parse

Multiple Dialects:


Me: Educational dialect for learning (8-12 years old)

Solo: Systems programming with LLVM backend

Duet: Async/concurrent programming targeting WebAssembly

Ensemble: Verification-focused with Isabelle integration



Static Typing with Inference: Strong types without verbosity

Linear Types: Resource safety through ownership and borrowing

Effect System: Track and control computational effects (I/O, AI, network, etc.)


🤖 AI Integration

Oblíbený is the first language with first-class AI integration:

(adaptive-def fibonacci (n: Int) -> Int
  @requires: energy < 100J
  @optimize: minimize latency
  @ai-strategy: choose-best
  
  (@solution "memoized"
    @when: n > 20
    @provides: energy: 50J, latency: 5ms
    (memo-fib n))
  
  (@solution "naive"
    @provides: energy: 10J, latency: 100ms
    (if (<= n 1) n
        (+ (fibonacci (- n 1))
           (fibonacci (- n 2))))))


AI Effect Types:

(def analyze-sentiment (text: String) -> (AIEffect Sentiment)
  @model: "gpt-4"
  @budget: tokens: 500, cost: $0.01
  @fallback: rule-based-sentiment
  ...)



🔒 Security Guarantees



Termination Proofs: All deployment code is proven to terminate

Resource Bounds: Static verification of memory, energy, and time limits

No Undefined Behavior: Formal semantics with total functions

Capability-Based Security: Fine-grained permission control


🌐 BOINC-Powered Verification

Oblíbený uses BOINC for distributed formal verification:


Crowd-Sourced Testing: Millions of random programs tested by volunteers

Grammar Evolution: Test results refine the EBNF specification

Property Database: Repository of proven theorems about the language

Performance Baselines: Compare against all major languages

Platform Coverage: Verify behavior across architectures

Project Components

JanusKey

JanusKey is a security utility that demonstrates Oblíbený's "Maximal Principle Reduction" philosophy:

# Encrypt a file (provably reversible)
januskey encrypt document.txt --output document.jk

# Decrypt it
januskey decrypt document.jk --output document.txt

# Verify reversibility
januskey verify document.txt document.jk


Security Guarantees:


✅ Zero information loss

✅ Cryptographically secure

✅ Formally verified reversibility

✅ Side-channel resistant

✅ No hidden state

Language Examples

Resource-Bounded Computing


(def process-batch (data: List[Item]) -> Result[Summary]
  @resources:
    memory: 1GB
    energy: 500J
    time: 30s
  
  @carbon-aware: prefer-renewable
  
  (transaction "batch-processing"
    (map-reduce process-item aggregate data)))


Linear Types for Safety


(def transfer-funds (from: Account, to: Account, amount: Money) 
                    -> (IO (Result Unit))
  ; Money is a linear type - can't be duplicated or lost
  (with-transaction
    (let funds (withdraw from amount))  ; from loses ownership
    (deposit to funds)                  ; funds transferred, can't be reused
    (Ok ())))


Reversible Transactions


(transaction "user-registration"
  @rollback-on: EmailExists | InvalidUsername

  (checkpoint "create-user")
  (create-user-record user-data)
  
  (checkpoint "send-email")
  (send-welcome-email email)
  
  @on-rollback: (fn (checkpoint)
    (log "Registration failed at: {checkpoint}")))


AI-Powered Code Generation


(def generate-parser (grammar: EBNF) -> (AIEffect Parser)
  @model: "claude-sonnet-4"
  @budget: tokens: 5000, cost: $0.50

  (ai-generate-code
    "Create a parser for this grammar: {grammar}"
