== What is Oblivious Computing?

Oblivious computing hides access patterns and data access from observers,
providing strong privacy guarantees beyond encryption alone. These tools
enable building privacy-preserving applications.

== Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyperpolymath/oblibeny.git
```
